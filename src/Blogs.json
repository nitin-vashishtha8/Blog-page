        "description" : "CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score) is a key performance indicator (KPI) used to measure customer satisfaction with a product, service, or experience. It is typically assessed through surveys or feedback forms that ask customers to rate their satisfaction on a scale, often ranging from 1 to 5 or 1 to 10. CSAT scores help businesses gauge how well they are meeting customer expectations and identify areas for improvement. A higher CSAT score indicates greater customer satisfaction, while a lower score may signal the need for changes in products, services, or customer support.",
